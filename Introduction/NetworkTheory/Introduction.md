   Basic Concepts
Electric Charge:

𝑄
=
𝑛
𝑒
Q=ne (where 
𝑛
n is the number of electrons, 
𝑒
e is the elementary charge)
Law of Conservation of Charge:

Total charge before a process = Total charge after the process
Electric Current:

𝐼
=
𝑑
𝑄
𝑑
𝑡
I= 
dt
dQ
​
  (where 
𝑄
Q is the charge, 
𝑡
t is time)
Conventional Current vs. Electron Current:

Conventional current flows from positive to negative, whereas electron flow is from negative to positive.
Electric Potential Difference (Voltage):

𝑉
=
𝑊
/
𝑄
V=W/Q (where 
𝑊
W is work done, 
𝑄
Q is charge)
