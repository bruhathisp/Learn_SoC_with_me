### Transcript Summary

#### Embedded Systems
- **Definition**: A combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function, not as a general-purpose computer.
- **Components**: Typically includes a microcomputer with mechanical, chemical, and electrical devices programmed for dedicated purposes.
- **Examples**: Devices like microphones, remote controls, washing machines, refrigerators, cars, printers, medical devices, TVs, and routers.

#### Cyber-Physical Systems
- **Definition**: Systems combining physical devices (the plant) with computers controlling them. Embedded computers form the cyber part of these systems.

#### Markets Using Embedded Systems
- **Categories**: Home, automotive, office, medical, industrial, consumer electronics, and networking.
- **Examples**:
  - Home: Washing machines, refrigerators, microwaves.
  - Automotive: Modern cars with numerous chips, especially autonomous vehicles.
  - Office: Printers, photocopiers, coffee machines.
  - Medical: Infusion pumps, blood pressure monitors.
  - Industrial: Robots, motors, elevator controllers.
  - Consumer Electronics: TVs, smartphones, set-top boxes, smartwatches, toys.
  - Networking: Routers, hubs.

#### Characteristics of Embedded Systems
- **Functionality**: Perform specific functions with limited hardware and software capabilities.
- **Operation**: Often run in a never-ending loop, waiting for user input or a timer.
- **Custom Design**: Designed for dedicated functions, such as remote controls or medical devices.

### Key Points on Embedded Systems:

- **Main Loop**:
  - **Structure**: Embedded systems typically operate on a main loop structure, running `while(1) {}` continuously.
  - **Behavior**: Unlike regular programs that may execute a return and exit, embedded programs do not exit. They continuously wait for user input, timers, or other triggers to perform their tasks.

- **General vs. Embedded Computer Systems**:
  - **General Computer Systems**:
    - **Components**: Include one or more microprocessors, large primary memory (RAM, DRAM), secondary memory (HDD, SSD), and often run on operating systems like Linux, Windows, or iOS.
    - **Purpose**: General-purpose computing with the capability to run various application software and provide user interfaces.
  - **Embedded Computer Systems**:
    - **Components**: Include necessary hardware and I/O for specific functions, often using read-only memory for program storage.
    - **Operation**: May run a real-time operating system (RTOS) or operate without any OS (bare-metal).
    - **Purpose**: Designed for dedicated functions, such as controlling a medical monitor or an air conditioning system.

#### Examples of Embedded Systems
- **Air Conditioning System**: Uses sensors, ADCs, controls, displays, remote interfaces, on-chip flash, and RAM.
- **Portable Music Player (e.g., iPod)**: Includes controls, display, memory, digital signal processor, power management, and wireless connectivity.

#### SoC (System on Chip) Examples
- **NVIDIA Tegra 2**: A generic SoC with ARM cores, cache, video encoders, GPU, memory controllers, and various interfaces. Used in tablets like Acer and Samsung Galaxy Tab.
- **Apple SoC Families**: From A4 to A7, progressing to M1 and M2, integrating ARM cores, GPUs, and other components. Found in devices like iPads and Macs.

#### Detailed Example: Apple A5 SoC
- **Components**: Includes two ARM cores, four GPUs, DDR interface, accelerators, and various I/Os. Found in the iPad 2.
