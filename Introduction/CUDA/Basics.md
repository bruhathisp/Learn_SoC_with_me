# Thread, warps, Blocks and grids


**NOTE:** Warps and thread blocks are different. Warps are not explicitly managed by the programmer but are automatically formed by the GPU hardware

In matrix multiplication implemented in CUDA, we primarily use thread blocks, not warps, to organize and execute the computation efficiently. Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Thread Blocks**:
   - In CUDA programming for matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for computing a portion of the resulting matrix.
   - Threads within a block are organized in a way that allows them to cooperatively load data into shared memory, perform computations, and synchronize when necessary.
   - The size and configuration of thread blocks are chosen to maximize GPU occupancy and performance.

2. **Warps**:
   - Warps, on the other hand, are groups of 32 threads that execute instructions in SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) fashion.
   - Within each thread block, threads are grouped into warps automatically by the GPU hardware.
   - Warps ensure that threads within the same warp execute the same instruction simultaneously, but on different data elements.

### Why Not Warps:
- While warps execute instructions in lockstep, they are not explicitly managed in matrix multiplication implementations. Instead, thread blocks are the primary organizational unit that CUDA programmers manipulate to achieve efficient parallelism.
- **"lockstep" execution refers to the simultaneous execution of threads within a warp**

In the context of vector addition using CUDA, warps play a crucial role in how the GPU executes the operations. Here’s how warps are relevant and used in vector addition:


### Conclusion:
In vector addition using CUDA, warps are not explicitly managed by the programmer but are automatically formed by the GPU hardware. They enable efficient SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) execution, where multiple threads within a warp execute the same operation on different data elements. This parallel execution at the warp level is essential for achieving high throughput and performance on GPU architectures.
